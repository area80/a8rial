AS3 GPU3D Mobile Map Engine
Mobile GPU3D Map Engine to Create 60fps Map on Mobile Application.

In 2012 there was no Map Engine that runs smootly (60fps) on Mobile Device, so no problem... I created it.
This supports many map data like OpenMap, Google (Un-Official)
And also has PolyLine Features to Create Route (GoogleMap)
